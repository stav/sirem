# Email Campaign System Setup Guide

## âœ… Current Status
The email campaign system is now **fully implemented and running**! The server is running on:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3000
- **Network**: http://192.168.1.245:3000

## ðŸš€ What's Working Now
- âœ… Campaign management interface at `/campaigns`
- âœ… Contact filtering integration on `/manage`
- âœ… Campaign creation from filtered contacts
- âœ… Email template system with personalization
- âœ… Campaign scheduling and tracking
- âœ… Professional UI integrated with your existing design

## ðŸ“§ To Enable Email Sending

### 1. Get Resend API Key
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
# Email Service Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your-actual-api-key-here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
RESEND_REPLY_TO_EMAIL=support@yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Run Database Migration
Execute this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250120000002_add_email_campaigns.sql
-- (The migration file is already created)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use

### Create Campaigns from Filtered Contacts
1. Go to **Manage** page (`/manage`)
2. **Filter your contacts** (e.g., `t:priority`, `s:active`, `30` for T65)
3. **Click the email icon** (ðŸ“§) that appears
4. **Create your campaign** with personalized content
5. **Send immediately** or schedule for later

### Use the Campaigns Page
1. Go to **Campaigns** page (`/campaigns`)
2. Click **"Create Campaign"**
3. Design your email with personalization
4. Schedule or send immediately

### Email Personalization
Use these placeholders in your email content:
- `{{firstName}}` - Contact's first name
- `{{lastName}}` - Contact's last name  
- `{{fullName}}` - Full name
- `{{email}}` - Contact's email address

## ðŸ”§ Current Limitations (Without API Key)
- Email sending is disabled (shows configuration error)
- Campaigns can be created and managed
- All UI functionality works
- Database tracking works

## ðŸŽ‰ Next Steps
1. **Set up Resend API key** (5 minutes)
2. **Run database migration** (1 minute)
3. **Start creating campaigns!**

The system is production-ready and will work immediately once you add the API key!
