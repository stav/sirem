# Component Architecture - Manage Page

## Overview

The manage page has been refactored from a single 900+ line file into a modular, maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Component Structure

### Main Page Component

- **`src/app/manage/page.tsx`** - Main orchestrator component (now ~200 lines)
  - Manages UI state and coordinates between components
  - Uses custom hooks for data management
  - Handles form submissions and user interactions

### UI Components

- **`src/components/ContactCard.tsx`** - Individual contact display
  - Shows contact information with status badges
  - Handles edit/delete actions
  - Supports single contact view mode

- **`src/components/ActionCard.tsx`** - Individual action display
  - Shows action details with priority badges
  - Handles complete/edit/delete actions
  - Displays timestamps and completion status

- **`src/components/ContactList.tsx`** - Contact list container
  - Manages contact list display logic
  - Handles empty states and add contact actions
  - Coordinates with ContactCard components

- **`src/components/ActionList.tsx`** - Action list container
  - Manages action list display logic
  - Filters actions by selected contact
  - Handles empty states and add action actions

### Form Components

- **`src/components/ContactForm.tsx`** - Contact add/edit modal
  - Reusable form for creating and editing contacts
  - Handles form validation and submission
  - Modal with backdrop click to close

- **`src/components/ActionForm.tsx`** - Action add/edit modal
  - Reusable form for creating and editing actions
  - Handles form validation and submission
  - Modal with escape key and backdrop click to close

### Custom Hooks

- **`src/hooks/useContacts.ts`** - Contact data management
  - Fetches, creates, updates, and deletes contacts
  - Handles loading states
  - Integrates with logging system

- **`src/hooks/useActions.ts`** - Action data management
  - Fetches, creates, updates, and deletes actions
  - Handles action completion toggling
  - Manages loading states

### Utilities

- **`src/lib/contact-utils.ts`** - Shared utility functions
  - Date formatting
  - Phone number formatting
  - Status badge generation

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. **Maintainability**

- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- Clear separation between UI and business logic

### 2. **Reusability**

- Components can be reused across different pages
- Form components are generic and flexible
- Utility functions are shared across components

### 3. **Testability**

- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Custom hooks can be tested independently
- Clear interfaces make mocking easier

### 4. **Performance**

- Components only re-render when their specific props change
- Custom hooks optimize data fetching and caching
- Reduced bundle size through better tree shaking

### 5. **Developer Experience**

- Easier to understand and navigate codebase
- Faster development with focused components
- Better IDE support with TypeScript interfaces

## Data Flow

```
ManagePage (Orchestrator)
├── useContacts Hook (Data Management)
├── useActions Hook (Data Management)
├── ContactList Component
│   └── ContactCard Components
├── ActionList Component
│   └── ActionCard Components
├── ContactForm Component (Modal)
└── ActionForm Component (Modal)
```

## Adding New Features

### To add a new contact field:

1. Update the `ContactFormData` interface in `useContacts.ts`
2. Add the field to `ContactForm.tsx`
3. Update the database operations in `useContacts.ts`
4. Display the field in `ContactCard.tsx`

### To add a new action feature:

1. Update the `ActionFormData` interface in `useActions.ts`
2. Add the field to `ActionForm.tsx`
3. Update the database operations in `useActions.ts`
4. Display the feature in `ActionCard.tsx`

### To add a new page:

1. Create new components following the same pattern
2. Create custom hooks for data management
3. Reuse existing UI components where possible
4. Follow the established naming conventions

## Best Practices

1. **Keep components focused** - Each component should have a single responsibility
2. **Use TypeScript interfaces** - Define clear contracts between components
3. **Leverage custom hooks** - Extract data management logic from components
4. **Share utilities** - Avoid duplicating common functions
5. **Follow naming conventions** - Use consistent naming across the codebase
6. **Handle loading states** - Provide good UX during data operations
7. **Error handling** - Implement proper error boundaries and user feedback

## Future Enhancements

This modular architecture makes it easy to add:

- Advanced filtering and search
- Bulk operations
- Real-time updates
- Offline support
- Advanced analytics
- Custom themes
- Accessibility improvements
